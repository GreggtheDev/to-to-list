Let's create a simple to-do application! Everyone can use a good to-do list, and this one will also serve to give you a chance to apply some of those JS skills.

 

Create a to-do list and it must accomplish the following things:

Show an unordered list of to-do items
Show an input to enter a new to-do
Show a button to add a to-do. When the button is clicked:
The text from the input box is used to add a list item to the bottom of the list
The text from the input box is cleared out.
When the user clicks on a list item, it is removed
 

Challenge (Optional)

When a list item is clicked, cross it out, then remove it after 1 second.
Add items into browser stroage
 

Additional Considerations

While the main focus of this exercise is to test to see your JavaScript, this is also one of your first applications that we can see in the browser. Do you know what that means?? You can employ some of your handy HTML and CSS skills you have learned thus far. I would love to see some creative lists and great use of styling to enhance the look and feel of your app.
